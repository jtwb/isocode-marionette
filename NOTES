1.  To make the dperry example work, I had to add {pushState: true} to Backbone.history.start(). Otherwise, `checkUrl` polls indefinitely and the renderer does not terminate.

2.  I found that jsdom's setInterval led to infinite recursion. Possibly related to the window <-> this alias - it seems the closure-scoped pointer resolved to jsdom's wrapper instead of native code. Deleted setTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval wrappers from jsdom.
