Isocode
=======

Isomorphic Javascript renderer

 - for Backbone.Marionette

Uses node-jquery, jsdom, contextify, htmlparser, xmlhttprequest and describe to run the target code in a big fake browser environment which writes out an HTML string at the end.

Inspired by AirBnB Rendr and Facebook React.
